## Next steps:

- [ ] Work on the datasets and pre-process if needed.
    - [ ] We want to use the maximum amount of data possible. We also need to have coherent
     representations between EEG in input. Video processing?
    - [ ] Design a pre processing pipeline
- [ ] Try the BrainBERT on the other datasets.
- [ ] Try to run also NeuroGPT
- [ ] Fork the BrainBERT repository and update it in order to work as I did currently.
- [ ] Run embeddings of VATE on our current data
