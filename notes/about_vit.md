Istead of using ViVit I could use ViT and handle stuff myself in network. As explained here:

Exactly 👍 — let’s unpack this carefully with your notation:

---

### Your proposed video tensor

$$
(b,\; T,\; F,\; 3,\; 224,\; 224)
$$

* **b** = batch size
* **T** = number of **temporal intervals** (aligned to your EEG segmentation, e.g. 5 chunks of 2 s)
* **F** = number of **frames per interval** you keep (maybe 8, 16, etc.)
* **3, 224, 224** = RGB frame size

---

### How it flows in the **per-frame ViT + temporal mixer** setup

1. **Frame encoder (CLIP-ViT per frame)**

    * Flatten `T×F` frames → pass through ViT independently.
    * Each frame → embedding $e_{t,f} \in \mathbb{R}^D$.
    * Output: $(b,\; T,\; F,\; D)$.

2. **Temporal mixer (GRU/TCN/S4/Mamba)**

    * Applied **within each interval (over F)** or across the whole $T·F$ sequence.
    * Typical choice: keep the EEG’s segmentation, so mixer works over **F frames per interval**.
    * Output stays $(b,\; T,\; F,\; D)$.

3. **Compression (PMA / Perceiver Resampler)**

    * Reduce $F$ frames → $n$ latents per interval.
    * Output: $(b,\; T,\; n,\; D)$.
    * Now perfectly matches what your Gated X-Attn expects.

4. **Fusion (EEG queries)**

    * EEG tokens: $(b,\; S_{\text{eeg}},\; D)$.
    * Media latents: $(b,\; T,\; n,\; D)$.
    * Cross-attention with time masks: each EEG segment only sees its corresponding interval’s $n$ latents.

---

### About **padding F**

* Yes, you’ll often **pad/truncate F** to a fixed value (say 16 or 32) for batching.
* That’s the same compromise ViViT makes: all clips → same #frames.
* Mask out the padded frames before the temporal mixer/PMA so they don’t leak.

---

### Key difference vs. ViViT

* **ViViT:** Flatten all `(T·F·patches)` and run global attention → heavy, less aligned.
* **Your pipeline:** Keep `(T, F)` structure → temporal mixer (linear cost) → compress to `n` latents per interval. Much
  easier to align with EEG.

---

✅ So yes, your `video: (b, T, F, 3, 224, 224)` is the right design:

* `T` matches EEG segmentation,
* `F` frames per segment (padded as needed),
* Later collapsed into `n` latents per interval for fusion.

---

Do you want me to sketch a PyTorch-style pseudo-forward pass from `(b,T,F,3,224,224)` all the way to `(b,T,n,D)` so you
can see exactly how to wire ViT, mixer, and PMA together?



Great you ask this — the distinction is subtle but important:

---

## 🔹 ViT (per-frame, e.g. CLIP-ViT)

* Treats each **frame independently**:

  $$
  \text{frame}_t \;\to\; \text{ViT encoder} \;\to\; e_t \in \mathbb{R}^D
  $$
* Stack them → `(B, T, D)`.
* Then you add your **own temporal mixer** (GRU/TCN/S4).
* ✅ Pros:

  * You can **reuse frozen CLIP-ViT checkpoints** (massive advantage with small data).
  * Modular: easy to align each frame with EEG.
  * Lighter compute (process each frame with 2D ViT, not one giant 3D transformer).
* ⚠️ Cons:

  * Temporal structure is **not baked in**; you must learn it with the mixer.

---

## 🔹 ViViT (Video Vision Transformer)

* A **video-native transformer**.
* Input = full clip `(T, H, W)` → patchify across space *and* time.
* Learns spatio-temporal attention directly.
* ✅ Pros:

  * End-to-end, strong inductive bias for video tasks.
  * Pretrained on Kinetics-400/600 etc.
* ⚠️ Cons:

  * **Quadratic cost in T·patches**, expensive for long clips.
  * Temporal alignment is less explicit — harder to line up with EEG tokens.
  * Pretraining is on action recognition datasets (might not match your EEG domain).

---

## 💡 For your EEG-centric fusion

* Since EEG is the **primary modality**, you want media encoders that yield **clean temporal tokens** you can align (and mask) against EEG time steps.
* **Per-frame ViT + temporal mixer** gives you exactly `(B, T_frames, D)` — simple to align.
* ViViT will give you a big flattened token soup `(B, T×patches, D)`; you’d have to reshape/unpatch to get temporal alignment.

---

## ⚖️ Which to choose?

* **Small/medium dataset, need EEG alignment, want frozen vision backbone → ViT (CLIP) per frame + temporal mixer.**
* **Big video dataset, want strongest pure video encoder → ViViT (or VideoMAE/TimeSformer).**
* In practice, **ViT+temporal mixer is more robust and modular** for multimodal fusion like yours.

---

👉 If we go ViT route, I’d suggest:

* Use a **frozen CLIP-ViT-B/16** for per-frame embeddings.
* Add a **tiny temporal mixer** (GRU/TCN/S4).
* Then compress with PMA/Perceiver and feed to Gated X-Attn with EEG queries.

Do you want me to draft a **side-by-side diagram** of “ViT+temporal mixer” vs. “ViViT” in your pipeline so you can see how they plug into the EEG fusion block?
