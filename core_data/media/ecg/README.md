## Choice of FM:

- https://github.com/bowang-lab/ECG-FM/tree/main/data TolerantECG study showed it performs well with missing leads. It
  is well-known so I'd pick this
- https://github.com/Fsoft-AIC/TolerantECG : Good with missing leads but might be too recent.
- https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECGFounder A good baseline.

### About missing leads:

For AMIGOS: Map your leads: RA & LA = effectively lead I. If you have RA & LL, youâ€™d also get lead II.
