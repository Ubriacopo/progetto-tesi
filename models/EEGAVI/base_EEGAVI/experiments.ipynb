    "**Why treat annotations as modalities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Richer representation learning**: Valence/arousal/dominance and emotion labels contain structured information about human subjective experience that can help your model learn more nuanced multimodal representations. This is especially valuable for EEG data, where the subjective experience is often what you're trying to decode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foundation model flexibility**: As a foundation model, you want representations that can generalize to many downstream tasks. Encoding these annotations as modalities makes them available for various use cases - some might need arousal prediction, others emotion classification, others might benefit from valence-aware representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-modal learning**: The model can learn relationships between EEG patterns, video content, and subjective ratings. This could help it understand, for example, how certain EEG signatures relate to high arousal states or specific emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical implementation approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embed the annotations**: Create simple embedders for the numerical ratings (valence/arousal/dominance/familiarity/liking) and categorical emotions\n",
    "2. **Multi-task learning**: Include reconstruction/prediction losses for these modalities alongside your main objectives\n",
    "3. **Masking strategy**: During training, randomly mask some annotation modalities so the model learns to infer missing subjective states\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid approach**: You could do both - use them as modalities for representation learning AND as supervised targets for some training objectives. This gives you the benefits of both approaches.\n",
