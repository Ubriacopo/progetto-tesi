    "Given you still resample video/audio to **64 tokens each (D=768)** and plan to use **EEG as queries (Q)**, your choice—**gated cross-attention**—is spot on. You have genuine token sets on the KV side, so the LM/decoder (driven by EEG queries) can selectively ground into different audio/video regions. No need to switch paradigms.\n",

    "# Keep gated cross-attention (yes)\n",

    "* You’ve got **M=64** tokens per modality → cross-attn has something to attend to. The gate is valuable to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. stabilize early training (init near 0),\n",
    "  2. let the model *decide* when EEG should trust A/V context,\n",
    "  3. support future multi-media without refactors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to fuse A+V with EEG (QKV design)\n",
    "\n",
    "You have three good options; all keep the “gated-XAttn” flavor:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parallel, per-modality branches + residual add (recommended first)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Compute two cross-attn branches in parallel:\n",
    "     $Y_v = \\text{XAttn}(Q_{eeg}, K_v, V_v)$, $Y_a = \\text{XAttn}(Q_{eeg}, K_a, V_a)$\n",
    "   * Gate each branch: $\\hat Y_v = g_v \\cdot P_v(Y_v)$, $\\hat Y_a = g_a \\cdot P_a(Y_a)$\n",
    "   * Fuse by addition: $Q' = Q_{eeg} + \\hat Y_v + \\hat Y_a$\n",
    "   * Use **separate K/V projections per modality** (don’t share) and tiny projection heads $P_v,P_a$ (Linear+Dropout).\n",
    "   * Initialization: set $g_v=g_a\\approx 0$ (e.g., logit init −3 to −5 or just a 0 param passed through tanh/sigmoid).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concat KV with modality tags (simple, cheaper)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $K = [K_v; K_a]$, $V = [V_v; V_a]$; add a **modality embedding** to K and V.\n",
    "   * Single gated branch: $Q' = Q_{eeg} + g \\cdot P(\\text{XAttn}(Q_{eeg}, K, V))$\n",
    "   * Add a **length-balancing sampler** if one modality dominates token count.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Competitive gating (mixture over modalities)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Compute both branches, produce **softmax gates** from $Q_{eeg}$:\n",
    "     $[w_v,w_a]=\\text{softmax}(W\\cdot \\text{Pool}(Q_{eeg}))$\n",
    "   * Fuse: $Q' = Q_{eeg} + w_v\\hat Y_v + w_a\\hat Y_a$\n",
    "   * Helps when one modality is occasionally useless/noisy.\n",

    "All three are fine; (1) is the most robust and easiest to ablate.\n",

    "# Small but important details\n",

    "* **Dim align:** Your video is already 768; audio is 1024→768 via ISAB/PMA projector. Keep **per-modality LayerNorm + Linear** into a **shared d\\_model** (768).\n",
    "* **Positional/temporal cues:** Even after resampling, inject **relative position encodings** per modality (RoPE or learned rel-bias). For videos, you can carry a **frame-index rel bias** into K/V; for audio, a **chunk index**. It helps EEG queries map to correct time neighborhoods.\n",
    "* **Cross-modal time banding (optional):** If you can align EEG time indices to A/V indices, add a **banded attention mask** that softly favors nearby K/V timesteps (e.g., bias matrix with −∞ outside a ±Δ window).\n",
    "* **Depth placement:** Interleave blocks:\n",
    "  `[SelfAttn(EEG) → GatedXAttn(A) → GatedXAttn(V) → MLP] × N`\n",
    "  or use the concat-KV variant once per block to save compute.\n",
    "* **Gates:** Scalar per branch is usually enough. If unstable, switch to **vector gates** (per-channel) with LN on branch outputs.\n",
    "* **Token budget:** 64v + 64a = 128 KV tokens. If EEG query length is large, consider **KV downsample** to 32 each without big quality loss. Keep head dim modest (e.g., 8 heads × 96 = 768).\n",

    "This is a great question about how to best leverage rich human annotations. Given that you're building a foundation model, I'd recommend **using these annotations as additional modalities** rather than just supervised targets, for several compelling reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why treat annotations as modalities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Richer representation learning**: Valence/arousal/dominance and emotion labels contain structured information about human subjective experience that can help your model learn more nuanced multimodal representations. This is especially valuable for EEG data, where the subjective experience is often what you're trying to decode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foundation model flexibility**: As a foundation model, you want representations that can generalize to many downstream tasks. Encoding these annotations as modalities makes them available for various use cases - some might need arousal prediction, others emotion classification, others might benefit from valence-aware representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-modal learning**: The model can learn relationships between EEG patterns, video content, and subjective ratings. This could help it understand, for example, how certain EEG signatures relate to high arousal states or specific emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical implementation approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embed the annotations**: Create simple embedders for the numerical ratings (valence/arousal/dominance/familiarity/liking) and categorical emotions\n",
    "2. **Multi-task learning**: Include reconstruction/prediction losses for these modalities alongside your main objectives\n",
    "3. **Masking strategy**: During training, randomly mask some annotation modalities so the model learns to infer missing subjective states\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid approach**: You could do both - use them as modalities for representation learning AND as supervised targets for some training objectives. This gives you the benefits of both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems particularly powerful for EEG foundation models since subjective experience is often the ground truth you're ultimately trying to understand from neural signals."

    "### 1. If ratings **are not available at inference** (most foundation-model scenarios)\n",
