    "\n",
    "**Richer representation learning**: Valence/arousal/dominance and emotion labels contain structured information about human subjective experience that can help your model learn more nuanced multimodal representations. This is especially valuable for EEG data, where the subjective experience is often what you're trying to decode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foundation model flexibility**: As a foundation model, you want representations that can generalize to many downstream tasks. Encoding these annotations as modalities makes them available for various use cases - some might need arousal prediction, others emotion classification, others might benefit from valence-aware representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-modal learning**: The model can learn relationships between EEG patterns, video content, and subjective ratings. This could help it understand, for example, how certain EEG signatures relate to high arousal states or specific emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical implementation approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embed the annotations**: Create simple embedders for the numerical ratings (valence/arousal/dominance/familiarity/liking) and categorical emotions\n",
    "2. **Multi-task learning**: Include reconstruction/prediction losses for these modalities alongside your main objectives\n",
    "3. **Masking strategy**: During training, randomly mask some annotation modalities so the model learns to infer missing subjective states\n",

    "Yes — if your **sidecar branch directly takes the *ground-truth ratings*** (valence/arousal/dominance, emotions, liking, familiarity) as **inputs** during training **and you don’t have them at inference**, then it *is* a form of **label leakage**. The model would be “cheating,” since it sees the answers while learning.\n",

    "### How to avoid leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Don’t feed ground-truth ratings as features unless you also expect them at inference.**\n",
    "* Instead, if you want a “ratings sidecar” branch, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Predicted ratings** from another model (e.g. a lightweight estimator trained separately on stimuli or early EEG features).\n",
    "  * **Noisy / partial user inputs** at inference (e.g. quick sliders, few ratings for personalization).\n",
    "  * **Auxiliary embeddings** derived from clustering ratings across the dataset, so you’re not feeding the raw labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correct framing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training-only → supervision / KD**: Ratings are used to shape representation (safe).\n",
    "* **Inference-time optional modality** → only valid if you **really will have some rating inputs** at test time (e.g. user self-reports).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "🔑 So the sidecar isn’t inherently bad — it’s only “leakage” if you train with labels as inputs and then don’t have them at inference. If you want a truly general **foundation EEG model**, keep the ratings in the **supervision / KD role**. Only add them as an **input modality** if your application setting makes them *available at runtime*.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want me to propose a clean **two-mode architecture** (one with ratings-as-supervision-only, one with ratings-as-input when available) so you can keep both options without leakage?\n"

    "If you design the **ratings sidecar** with a **gate (modality dropout / fusion switch)**, then during **finetuning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A user who **has V/A/D ratings** (or some proxy, like sliders or predicted ratings) can plug them into the sidecar.\n",
    "* A user who **does not have V/A/D ratings** can **ignore the branch** — the EEG backbone and heads are already trained to work *without* it, because you forced that behavior during pretraining with dropout.\n",

    "* **Fine-tuning without V/A/D data → totally valid.** The model falls back to the EEG-only pathway.\n",
