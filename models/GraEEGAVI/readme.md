## A possible foundation model that leverages Graph Networks?

EEG data is a good fit for graphs for its spatial nature. <br>
This could be a further improvement over the first model designed.



Great question! GNNs can model complex inter-modal relationships that standard attention might miss. Here's how it could work for your multimodal case:

## Core Idea: Modalities as Graph Nodes

Instead of treating modalities as separate sequences, represent them as nodes in a graph where edges encode relationships (temporal, semantic, causal).

## Example Architecture

**Graph Construction:**
```
Nodes: [EEG_t1, EEG_t2, ..., Video_t1, Video_t2, ..., Audio_t1, Audio_t2, ...]

Edge Types:
- Temporal: EEG_t1 → EEG_t2 (within-modality temporal flow)
- Cross-modal: EEG_t1 ↔ Video_t1 (same timestamp)
- Causal: EEG_t1 → Video_t2 (EEG might predict future video)
- Semantic: Audio_speech ↔ Video_mouth (semantic correspondence)
```

**Architecture Flow:**
1. **Node Initialization**: Use your pretrained embedders
   ```python
   # Each timestep becomes a node
   eeg_nodes = eeg_embedder(eeg_segments)     # [T_eeg, d]
   video_nodes = video_embedder(video_clips)  # [T_video, d] 
   audio_nodes = audio_embedder(audio_clips)  # [T_audio, d]
   ```

2. **Graph Construction**: Build adjacency matrix
   ```python
   # Within-modality temporal edges
   # Cross-modal synchronization edges  
   # Learned semantic edges (optional)
   ```

3. **GNN Layers**: Message passing between nodes
   ```python
   for layer in gnn_layers:
       node_features = layer(node_features, edge_index, edge_attr)
   ```

4. **Readout**: Extract final representations
   ```python
   # Pool nodes by modality or use attention
   final_repr = readout_layer(node_features)
   ```

## Specific Example: Temporal-Semantic GNN

**Heterogeneous Graph with 4 Node Types:**
- `EEG_temporal`: EEG at each time step
- `Video_spatial`: Video regions/patches  
- `Audio_spectral`: Audio frequency bands
- `Fusion`: Special fusion nodes

**Edge Types & Meanings:**
- `EEG_temporal → EEG_temporal`: Temporal dynamics
- `EEG_temporal → Video_spatial`: Neural correlates of visual attention
- `EEG_temporal → Audio_spectral`: Auditory processing
- `Video_spatial → Audio_spectral`: Audio-visual synchrony
- `* → Fusion`: All modalities contribute to fusion nodes

**Message Passing:**
```python
class MultiModalGNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.conv1 = HeteroConv({
            ('eeg', 'temporal', 'eeg'): GCNConv(-1, 128),
            ('eeg', 'attends_to', 'video'): GATConv(-1, 128),
            ('audio', 'syncs_with', 'video'): SAGEConv(-1, 128),
            ('eeg', 'fuses_to', 'fusion'): TransformerConv(-1, 128),
            # ... more relations
        })
    
    def forward(self, x_dict, edge_index_dict):
        x_dict = self.conv1(x_dict, edge_index_dict)
        return x_dict['fusion']  # Return fusion node features
```

## Advantages for Your Case:

1. **Explicit Temporal Modeling**: Graph edges can encode temporal lag relationships (EEG leads video by 100ms)

2. **Flexible Relationships**: Can model non-uniform temporal sampling (EEG at 1000Hz, video at 30fps)

3. **Interpretability**: Edge weights tell you which cross-modal connections are important

4. **Scalability**: Add new modalities by adding new node/edge types

## When This Works Best:

- **Rich temporal dynamics** (EEG-video lag relationships)
- **Sparse interactions** (not all EEG channels relate to all video regions)
- **Hierarchical structure** (local brain regions → global cognition → behavior)
- **Multi-scale fusion** (different temporal resolutions across modalities)

**Potential Downsides:**
- More complex than attention-based fusion
- Graph construction adds computational overhead
- Need to design edge types carefully

Would this fit your specific use case? What kind of temporal relationships do you expect between EEG and your other modalities?
