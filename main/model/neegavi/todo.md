Al posto di avere window da start faccio da centro

Anzi prova a resample to all same fs
1-second text-now tokens, but context-aware (works well)\


Yes—sample **video at 1 Hz**, but compute each video token **causally** from a sliding past window.

* At second (t): (V_t = \text{ViViT}(\text{frames in }(t-W,,t])).
* Use stride (=1) s, window (W=3) s (what you liked about 3 s clips), so no future leakage.
* If compute is tight, (W) can be 2 s; quality usually improves with a bit more past.
* For early times ((t<W)), use the available shorter window or pad; keep the attention mask causal.

Fuse with your gated x-attn using only keys/values (\le t). This preserves strong ViViT context while aligning all modalities at 1 Hz.


Yep—your current Perceiver Resampler is spatial. Add a tiny temporal resampler on top (factorized space→time), keeping ViViT frozen.

Yep—your current Perceiver Resampler is **spatial**. Add a tiny **temporal** resampler on top (factorized space→time), keeping ViViT frozen.

**Factorized resampling (streamable & causal)**

1. **Per-frame spatial resampler (what you have):**

   * Input: ViViT patch tokens at time *t*: `X_t ∈ R^[P × D]`.
   * Output: `F_t ∈ R^[M × D]` (e.g., M=1–4 compact frame tokens).

2. **Temporal resampler (new, causal):**

   * Maintain a ring buffer `F_{t-K+1:t}` (last *K* seconds).
   * Queries: fixed `Q ∈ R^[R × D]` (R=1 if you want 1 Hz), or learned per-second `Q_t`.
   * Keys/Values: concat buffered frame tokens `KV = concat(F_{t-K+1},…,F_t)`; apply **causal mask**.
   * Output: `V_t ∈ R^[R × D]` (typically `R=1`) — your video-at-1 Hz token(s).

**Why factorize?**

* Keeps your existing patch/dim Perceiver intact.
* Temporal module is tiny (a few x-attn blocks), strictly causal, and easy to stream.
* Memory is `O(K·M·D)` not 3× overlapped clips.

**Shapes (typical choice)**

* `P`≈196–576 patch tokens; `M`=2; `K`=3–5 s; `R`=1.
* Keep `D` same as ViViT dim; optional proj to `d'<D` before temporal resampler.

**Masking & bias**

* Future mask: only keys with time ≤ *t*.
* Add relative-time bias (strong near-past).
* Optional **monotonic chunkwise attention** if you want partitions without bleed.

**Streaming sketch**

```python
# per second t
F_t = SpatialPerceiver(X_t)                 # M×D, frozen ViViT input
buf.append(F_t); buf = buf[-K:]             # keep last K seconds (each M×D)

V_t = TemporalResampler(Q, KV=concat(buf), causal=True)  # 1×D
```

**Regularization to “partition the right parts”**

* L1/entropy on temporal attn weights (peaky, local focus).
* Coverage loss over a window so different seconds cover different regions.
* Occasional video dropout so audio/EEG aligners stay useful.

**Integration with gated x-attn**

* Feed `V_t` (and optionally `V_{t-1:t-2}`) into your Flamingo-style gate with audio/EEG ≤ *t*.
* To avoid redundancy, residualize non-video features against **stop-grad** `V_t`.

**Alternative (heavier)**

* Single **3D Perceiver** over `(time × patch)` tokens with causal temporal masking. Great, but more memory; the factorized version above gets ~all the benefit cheaper.

This adds a **temporal Perceiver head**—turning your spatially resampled ViViT features into clean **1 Hz, causal video tokens** that align with EEG, without touching the frozen backbone.
