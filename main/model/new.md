love this—here are two tiny, concrete walk-throughs you can “run in your head.” I’ll use silly small sizes so the shapes are obvious.

# Option A — Time-aware cross-attention (keep native lengths)

## Setup

* Batch `B=1`
* EEG (queries): `T_eeg = 4`, `D=3`
  `q` shape: `[1, 4, 3]` with timestamps (sec) `t_eeg = [0.00, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30]`
* Video (already resampled per-frame spatially): `T_vid = 3`, `M=2` tokens per frame ⇒ `T_vid*M = 6` KV tokens
  `kv_vid` shape: `[1, 6, 3]` with frame times `t_vid = [0.02, 0.02, 0.12, 0.12, 0.22, 0.22]`
* Audio: `T_aud = 5` tokens
  `kv_aud` shape: `[1, 5, 3]`, `t_aud = [−0.02, 0.08, 0.18, 0.28, 0.38]`
* Text: keep 2 tokens (e.g., [CLS], [SEP]) without meaningful time ⇒ set `t_txt = [+∞, +∞]` or mask them out of time bias (see below)

Concatenate KV across modalities:

* `kv = cat([kv_vid, kv_aud, kv_txt], dim=1)` → `[1, 6+5+2=13, 3]`
* `t_kv = [0.02,0.02,0.12,0.12,0.22,0.22, -0.02,0.08,0.18,0.28,0.38, NaN, NaN]`
* `mask_kv = [1,1,1,1,1,1, 1,1,1,1,1, 1,1]` (1=valid). If you’d like text to *participate but not be time-biased*, keep mask=1 but set their **time-bias to 0** (see below).

## Attention logits (one head for simplicity)

1. Compute raw logits: `logits = q @ k^T * scale` → shape `[1, 4, 13]`

2. **Pad/causal masks** (if causal, invalidate KV with `t_kv > t_eeg[i]`):

   * For EEG step `i=1 (t=0.10)`, valid KV are those with time ≤ 0.10
     Here: indices with times `0.02,0.02,0.08` (and text if you allow it). Others get **−∞**.

3. **Time bias**: add a relative-time penalty
   `time_bias[i,j] = -α * min(|t_kv[j] - t_eeg[i]|, Δ_max)`

   Example for `α=10`, `Δ_max=0.15`:

   * At `t_eeg=0.10` vs video token at `0.12`: `|0.12-0.10|=0.02` ⇒ bias = `-0.2`
   * vs audio at `0.08`: diff `0.02` ⇒ `-0.2`
   * vs audio at `0.18`: diff `0.08` ⇒ `-0.8`
   * For **text** tokens, set `time_bias=0` (they’re not penalized or favored by time).

4. Final: `logits += pad_bias(−∞ where invalid) + time_bias`
   Then `attn = softmax(logits, dim=-1)`, `out = attn @ v`.

### What you gain

* You never upsample/downsample sequences; you **respect native `T`**.
* Synchrony comes from the **time bias** (and optional causality).
* Complexity is manageable because you’ve already reduced per-frame patches (e.g., 64→M=8 before this stage).

# Option B — Shared latent timeline (learned resampler across modalities)

Goal: build a **fixed, shared set of L timeline tokens** that summarize *all modalities*; then let EEG attend to those.

## Setup

Use the same modality tokens as above (video has 6 per example, audio 5, text 2). Choose `L=4` latent timeline slots.

1. **Initialize L learnable queries** `z ∈ ℝ^{L×D}`, each associated with a **time anchor** `τ = [0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35]` (you can make `τ` fixed or learnable; fixed is a good start).

2. Cross-attend `z` to the concatenated modality tokens `x = kv`:

   * Q = `W_q z` (`[L,D]→[L,d]`)
   * K,V = `W_{k,v} x` (shape `[T_sum,D]→[T_sum,d]`)
   * **Time-aware bias toward each slot’s anchor**:
     `bias[l, j] = -β * |t_kv[j] - τ[l]|` (0 for text or masked positions)
     This makes slot `l` “listen” mostly to tokens near its anchor time.

3. Softmax over `j` to get attention from each latent `l` onto all tokens; produce **L latent timeline tokens** `z' ∈ [L,D]`.

4. (Optional) Tiny **self-attn over `z'`** to let latents talk to each other.

5. EEG queries now attend to `z'` instead of the long raw KV:

   * `q_eeg (T_eeg=4)` cross-attend to `z' (L=4)` with a **smaller** (and time-anchored) context.

### Mini numeric example

* Suppose at `τ[1]=0.15`, the dominant inputs (by time) are video tokens at 0.12/0.12 and audio 0.18. With `β=10`, those get strong weights; tokens at 0.02 or 0.38 get down-weighted.
* The resulting `z'[1]` becomes a fused, time-localized summary near 0.15 sec that blends video+audio(+text if present).
* EEG step at `t=0.20` can now **prefer** `z'[2]` (anchor 0.25) due to a second time bias (optional) or just let the model learn this mapping.

### What you gain

* **Fixed cost** KV: from ~hundreds of tokens → `L` (e.g., 4–32).
* The shared latents act like a **learned, aligned timeline** that integrates modalities *before* EEG fusion.
* You can precompute `z'` once per clip/window, then run multiple EEG passes cheaply.

---

## Which to pick when?

* Pick **Option A** if you can afford a few hundred KV tokens and want **maximal fidelity**: EEG attends directly to real tokens, guided by time bias. This is the most transparent and often the most accurate early on.

* Pick **Option B** if KV is still too large (e.g., video/audio with many patches) or you want **one compact fused context**. Start with `L ≈ T_eeg` (e.g., 32), then try smaller (16/12/8) once training stabilizes.

---

## Implementation checkpoints (both options)

1. **Per-frame spatial resampling first** (Video 64→M, Audio freq-patches → M): keeps KV reasonable and preserves time.
2. **Robust masks**: boolean masks → **−∞ logits**; don’t rely on zero vectors.
3. **Time features**: store `t` arrays per token; build bias via `-|Δt|` (clipped). Keep text bias at 0.
4. **Causality (optional)**: disallow tokens with `t_kv > t_eeg[i]` if you need online behavior.
5. **Numerics**: start `α,β` small (e.g., 5–10); clip `|Δt|` by `Δ_max` (e.g., 150–250 ms) to avoid over-penalizing.

---

If you want, I can turn the above into 30–40 lines of PyTorch-ish pseudocode for each option (with explicit shapes, masks, and bias adds).
