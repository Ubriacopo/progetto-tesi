I’ve got (B, T, C, P, D) from CBraMod and need Q as (B, T, E) for Flamingo-style gated cross-attn. 
Here are the viable ways to get there, with crisp trade-offs.

### Choices & consequences

| #  | Choice                                        | How (shapes)                                                                                                             | Params & compute                                                                                               | What it preserves                                                                   | What you lose / risks                                                                                          | When to use                                                                                                   |
| -- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Global average over (C,P)**                 | `x: (B,T,C,P,D)` → mean over C,P → `(B,T,D)` → optional `Linear(D→E)` → `(B,T,E)`                                        | Very low. If you add a projection: \~D×E params.                                                               | Time dynamics (T) and feature D statistics; simple, stable.                         | Discards channel/patch structure; can wash out informative but sparse channels; treats all electrodes equally. | Strong baseline; when you need something fast/robust and parameter-light.                                     |
| 2  | **Flatten then project**                      | `x → (B,T, C·P·D)` → `Linear(C·P·D→E)` → `(B,T,E)`                                                                       | High. Example: C=32, P=8, D=256, E=1024 ⇒ **\~67.1M** weights (+bias).                                         | Maximum capacity; the projector can learn arbitrary mixing across channels/patches. | Heavy memory/overfit risk; brittle with variable C/P; slower training.                                         | Only if you have lots of data/regularization and really want raw capacity.                                    |
| 3a | **Make each (channel×patch) a query token**   | Reshape per time: `(B, T, C·P, D)` and treat Q as `(B, T·C·P, D)` (or project D→E first)                                 | Cross-attn cost explodes: O((T·C·P)·Nkv). E.g., T=50, C·P=256, Nkv=576 ⇒ \~7.4M attention scores/sample/layer. | Fine-grained queries; lets the text/video attend to specific electrodes/patches.    | Very expensive; tricky masking; may imbalance modalities.                                                      | If you **must** preserve fine granularity and can afford the cost (or have small T/C/P).                      |
| 3b | **Modify gated cross-attn to be factorized**  | Keep `(B,T,C·P,D)` and do *local pooling/attn* over C·P *inside* the module, then cross-attend using per-time summaries. | Medium (depends on your inner block).                                                                          | Learns which channels matter at each time before cross-modal fusion.                | Custom code/maintenance; careful init & masking.                                                               | If you’re comfortable touching the X-attn code and want principled per-time, channel-aware summarization.     |
| 4a | **PMA (Set Transformer) over (C·P) per time** | For each t: `(B, C·P, D) → PMA(k)` → `(B, k, E)`; then concat over time ⇒ `(B, T·k, E)` or mean over k ⇒ `(B,T,E)`       | Low–medium. k is small (e.g., 4–8). Scales as O(B·T·(C·P·E)).                                                  | Learns *weighted* pooling; keeps channel saliency; robust to variable C/P.          | Slightly more code: run PMA on `(B·T, C·P, D)` then unflatten.                                                 | **Recommended default** when you want light but learned pooling. Plays well with your earlier ISAB/PMA stack. |
| 4b | **Perceiver Resampler over (C·P) per time**   | For each t: latent m queries cross-attend to `(C·P, D)` → `(B, m, E)`; then `(B, T·m, E)` or pool m → `(B,T,E)`.         | Low–medium; very parameter-efficient; good with variable sets.                                                 | Strong learned summarization; handles big C·P gracefully; stable training.          | Slightly more moving parts; choose m carefully.                                                                | If you like Perceiver-style latents (you mentioned this earlier).                                             |
| 4c | **SE-style learned weights across channels**  | Compute channel/patch weights per t (e.g., MLP over `(C,P,D)` stats) → weighted sum over C,P → `(B,T,D)` → `Linear(D→E)` | Low.                                                                                                           | Learns to up/down-weight electrodes; still simple.                                  | Less expressive than PMA/resampler; relies on good statistics choice.                                          | When you want something barely more expressive than avg pooling.                                              |
| 4d | **Graph-aware pooling (electrode topology)**  | Build graph over channels; GAT/GCN over `(C,P,D)` → pool to r regions → `(B,T,r, E)` → mean over r or keep r tokens.     | Medium; cost depends on r and edges.                                                                           | Respects electrode geometry; good inductive bias.                                   | Requires channel coords; more engineering.                                                                     | If spatial neuro-topology matters for your task.                                                              |

### Practical notes (so you don’t hit gotchas)

* **Dimension match:** Most cross-attn blocks project Q/K/V internally, so E≠D is fine. If your gated block expects a fixed `d_model`, add a small `Linear(D→E)` after any pooling.
* **Vectorizing PMA/Resampler over time:** Flatten `(B,T, C·P, D)` → run pooling on `(B·T, C·P, D)` → reshape back to `(B,T, k or m, E)`. Mask T as usual.
* **Stability tips:** LayerNorm before pooling; optional per-channel z-score (robust to electrode scale drift).
* **Variable C/P:** Options 1, 4a–4b handle variable counts naturally. Option 2 becomes messy if C/P vary.
* **If you keep granularity (3a):** Consider first reducing tokens with a tiny resampler (m≪C·P) to keep costs sane, or only keep the top-k channels by learned score per time.

### What I’d do

* Ship a **clean baseline** with **Option 1** (avg over C,P → `(B,T,D)` → small Linear to E). It’s fast and lets you validate the rest of the stack.
* Then switch to **Option 4a (PMA)** or **4b (Perceiver Resampler)** per time step. They add a small amount of learned capacity to focus on informative electrodes/patches without blowing up parameters or code complexity.

If we adopt 4a/4b (or 3b), **let’s remember to update the architecture plot** (“Pasted image.png”) to show the per-time learned pooling block before gated cross-attention.
